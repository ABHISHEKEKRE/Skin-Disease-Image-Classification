This is the Kaggle link of the dataset called Dermnet
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhamgoel27/dermnet
The data consists of images of 23 types of skin diseases taken from http://www.dermnet.com/dermatology-pictures-skin-disease-pictures. The total number of images are around 19,500, out of which approximately 15,500 have been split in the training set and the remaining in the test set.
I have performed transfer learning on Mobilenet model as I wanted a light architecture model which can be used on websites/apps
After transfer learning I have also fine tuned it for 150 epochs.
